    I have previously worked on creating a Python personal finance application that I called Pysonal Finance Manager. The application utilized the mathlib library on Python, text input, and functions to calculate expenses and percentages to make a pie chart of expenses in dollars and percentages.  The application utilized the creation of an SQL database to store information to the "finance_mananger.db" database file. I have deemed this to be too complex for an introductory demonstration thus I have aborted it from the agenda of this demonstration. It does have commentary to help understand It repository, for your reference, is linked at: https://github.com/marenah/Pysonal-Finance-Manager/tree/main
